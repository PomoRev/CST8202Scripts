This is a repository for students in CST8202 to be able to work with github to grab PowerShell
scripts which support the lectures. These are the scripts we walked through in class.

My experience with PowerShell is that it is really fussy in terms of getting things to format just so. 
It would be worthwhile learning POSHgui or some other libraries to enhance the output. But for most
scripting needs it is about utility and not form. For your lab assignments I am looking for utility
and not worried about how pretty it looks. But it must be readable to be useful, so keep that balance
in mind when you are writing your scripts.

Happy Scripting!
